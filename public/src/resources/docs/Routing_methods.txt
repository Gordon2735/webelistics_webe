Routing methods

Express supports the following routing methods corresponding to the HTTP methods of the same names:

    checkout
    copy
    delete
    get
    head
    lock
    merge
    mkactivity

	

    mkcol
    move
    m-search
    notify
    options
    patch
    post

	

    purge
    put
    report
    search
    subscribe
    trace
    unlock
    unsubscribe

The API documentation has explicit entries only for the most popular HTTP methods app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete(). However, the other methods listed above work in exactly the same way.

To route methods that translate to invalid JavaScript variable names, use the bracket notation. For example, app['m-search']('/', function ....

The app.get() function is automatically called for the HTTP HEAD method in addition to the GET method if app.head() was not called for the path before app.get().

The method, app.all(), is not derived from any HTTP method and loads middleware at the specified path for all HTTP request methods. For more information, see app.all.
